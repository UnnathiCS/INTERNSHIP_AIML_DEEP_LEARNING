Face Emotion Recognition Using CNN and Haar Cascades

This project focuses on developing a facial emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion classification
and Haar Cascades for real-time face detection. The system is designed to classify emotions from facial expressions into categories such as happy, 
sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and others. The CNN model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, and OpenCV's Haar Cascades are used for detecting
faces in real-time video streams. The integration of these technologies enables accurate and efficient emotion recognition in real-time applications.
